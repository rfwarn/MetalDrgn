- Hi, I’m @MetalDrgn!
- I’m interested in **AI/ML, NLP, computer vision, AGI**, Python, Software Engineering, Data Analysis/Science, and Web Dev.
- I’m currently learning Machine Learning
- I’m looking to collaborate on automation initiatives/improvements in addition to AI
- Some projects I've built while in the Air Force that aren’t feasible to put on GitHub:
  - Excel deployment tracker for Squadron of ~400 individuals. Uses Power Query. Shows ready/not ready/deployed status along with date when dwell timer is up. Linked to two separate documents that can be updated independently then updated in the tool by refreshing. Slicers allow for easy filtering and charts reflect filtered data for improved oversight.
  - Air Force EPR/OPR/Awards Excel tool. Uses VBA. Found the automation need to identify frequent errors (mixed abbreviated/non-abbreviated words) and approved word abbreviations/acronyms for length fitting.
  - Excel tool to aid Air Force Reserve Command audit annual status codes. Imported employee and statuses into excel from text file using VBA. Used Power Query to load and merge other related documents and generate a final pivot table with all the compliance data sortable by slicers.
  - PowerApps tool for Air Force wide CPI (Continuous Process Improvement) program that allows for easy editing, finding, and updating practitioners. Uses SharePoint and Outlook365 connectors to locate members in a specific wing or installation and shows current email GAL information when updating. Also uses Power Automate to generate a searchable GAL listing for finding outliers. Coordinated implementation with various teams groups and official site. Validated interoperability with sharepoint managers at Headquarters Air Force.
